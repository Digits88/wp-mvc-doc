`MvcInflector` provides the following methods, which behave in the same way that [CakePHP's inflector methods](http://book.cakephp.org/view/1479/Class-methods) do.  They can be called statically, like this:

{% highlight php %}
<?php
MvcInflector::pluralize('cow');
?>
{% endhighlight %}

pluralize

singularize

camelize

tableize

underscore

titleize

pluralize_titleize
