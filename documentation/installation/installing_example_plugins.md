To install an example application:

1. Move its directory (e.g. `wp-content/plugins/wp-mvc/examples/events-calendar-example`) into the `wp-content/plugins/` directory (e.g. `wp-content/plugins/events-calendar-example`)
1. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress

After doing so, you should see administrative menus for each model in WordPress, and you'll be able to browse to URLs like `/events/`, `/events/1/`, `/venues/`, etc to see the public-facing views.

If you are seeing 404 errors when browsing to public WP MVC-based pages, the URL-rewriting rules generated by enabling ["pretty permalinks"](http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Permalinks#mod_rewrite:_.22Pretty_Permalinks.22) are most likely not active.  To fix the 404s, activate these rules by browsing to Settings > Permalinks Settings and choosing any setting other than the "Default" setting.
